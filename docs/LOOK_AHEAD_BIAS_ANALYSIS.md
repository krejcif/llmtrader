# üö® LOOK-AHEAD BIAS ANALYSIS

**Date:** 2025-10-27

## ‚úÖ UPDATE: FIX APPLIED

**Fixed in commit:** 2025-10-27  
**File modified:** `paper_trading.py` lines 101-114

The look-ahead bias has been **corrected**. Opposite signal exits now use **last closed candle price** instead of ticker price.

## ‚ùå CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND

### 1. **TICKER PRICE vs CLOSED CANDLE PRICE (Highest Severity)**

#### Problem Location: `binance_client.py:163` + `paper_trading.py:101`

```python
# binance_client.py - Line 163
current_price = self.get_current_price(symbol)  # ‚Üê REAL-TIME TICKER!

# paper_trading.py - Line 101
current_price = strategy_market_data.get('current_price')  # ‚Üê Uses ticker!
print(f"   Exit price: ${current_price:.2f} (close of last candle)")  # ‚Üê WRONG comment!
```

**THE ISSUE:**
- `get_current_price()` calls `futures_symbol_ticker()` which returns **REAL-TIME** mid-price/last trade
- Paper trading uses this for **exit price** (line 101, 125)
- The comment says "(close of last candle)" but it's actually **LIVE PRICE**
- This is **LOOK-AHEAD BIAS**: In backtesting/paper trading, you cannot use a price that hasn't closed yet!

**Impact:** üî¥ CRITICAL
- Trades are closed at real-time prices (not candle close)
- Creates unrealistic P&L in paper trading
- Results will NOT match real backtesting
- Example: If you check at 10:03 AM on a 5-min chart, you're using a price from the **current forming candle** (closes at 10:05)

---

### 2. **INCONSISTENT PRICE SOURCES (High Severity)**

#### Issue: Multiple Different Prices Used Throughout System

**In `decision_minimal.py` (Line 87):**
```python
CURRENT PRICE: ${market_data['current_price']}  # ‚Üê TICKER PRICE (real-time)
```

**In `indicators.py` (Lines 141, 199, 385, 417):**
```python
current_price = df['close'].iloc[-1]  # ‚Üê LAST CLOSED CANDLE
```

**In `calculate_stop_take_profit()` (Line 417):**
```python
atr_data = calculate_atr(df)
current_price = atr_data['current_price']  # ‚Üê From last CLOSED candle

# But then used for entry price:
risk_mgmt = calculate_stop_take_profit(candles_lower, direction)
# Entry: ${risk_mgmt['entry']}  ‚Üê This is CLOSED candle price
```

**THE PROBLEM:**
- **Entry price** in risk_mgmt uses **CLOSED candle** (correct ‚úÖ)
- **Exit price** in paper_trading uses **TICKER price** (WRONG ‚ùå)
- This creates artificial advantage: You enter on closed candle, exit on real-time price

**Impact:** üü† HIGH
- Entry and exit prices come from different time points
- Paper trading results are optimistic
- Not reproducible in real backtesting

---

### 3. **CANDLE DATA IS CORRECT (Good! ‚úÖ)**

#### Good Practice Found: `binance_client.py:72-76`

```python
# Remove last candle (incomplete/currently forming) for data integrity
# This ensures we only use CLOSED candles for analysis
if len(df) > 1:
    df = df.iloc[:-1].reset_index(drop=True)
```

**This is CORRECT:** ‚úÖ
- Removes the currently forming (incomplete) candle
- Only uses CLOSED candles for indicators
- Prevents look-ahead bias in technical analysis

## üìä LOOK-AHEAD BIAS SCORING

| Component | Status | Severity | Issue |
|-----------|--------|----------|-------|
| **Candle Data** | ‚úÖ CORRECT | None | Properly removes incomplete candles |
| **Indicators** | ‚úÖ CORRECT | None | Uses closed candle prices |
| **Entry Price** | ‚úÖ CORRECT | None | Uses last closed candle |
| **Exit Price (paper_trading)** | ‚ùå WRONG | üî¥ CRITICAL | Uses real-time ticker! |
| **AI Prompt Price** | ‚ö†Ô∏è MINOR | üü° LOW | Shows ticker (informational only) |
| **Price Consistency** | ‚ùå WRONG | üü† HIGH | Mixed sources throughout |

## üîß HOW TO FIX

### Solution 1: Use CLOSED Candle Price for Exits (RECOMMENDED)

**Modify `paper_trading.py:101`:**

```python
# BEFORE (WRONG):
current_price = strategy_market_data.get('current_price')  # Ticker price

# AFTER (CORRECT):
# Get last CLOSED candle price from the timeframe data
tf_lower = state.get('analysis', {}).get('indicators', {}).get('lower_tf', {}).get('timeframe', '5m')
if tf_lower and strategy_market_data.get('timeframes', {}).get(tf_lower) is not None:
    last_closed_candle = strategy_market_data['timeframes'][tf_lower]
    current_price = last_closed_candle['close'].iloc[-1]  # Last CLOSED candle
else:
    # Fallback to ticker (should not happen in normal flow)
    current_price = strategy_market_data.get('current_price')
    print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: Using ticker price as fallback (no closed candle data)")
```

### Solution 2: Add `current_price_closed` to Market Data

**Modify `binance_client.py:163-180`:**

```python
def get_multi_timeframe_data(self, symbol: str, timeframes: List[str], limit: int = 100) -> Dict:
    # Get ticker price (real-time)
    ticker_price = self.get_current_price(symbol)
    
    # Get candles for each timeframe
    timeframe_data = {}
    for tf in timeframes:
        candles = self.get_klines(symbol, tf, limit)
        timeframe_data[tf] = candles
    
    # Extract last CLOSED price from primary timeframe (first one)
    primary_tf_candles = timeframe_data[timeframes[0]]
    last_closed_price = float(primary_tf_candles['close'].iloc[-1])
    
    return {
        "symbol": symbol,
        "current_price": ticker_price,  # Real-time (for display only)
        "current_price_closed": last_closed_price,  # Last CLOSED candle (for trading)
        "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
        "timeframes": timeframe_data,
        "funding_rate": self.get_funding_rate(symbol),
        "orderbook": self.get_orderbook(symbol, limit=100)
    }
```

**Then in `paper_trading.py`:**
```python
# Use closed price for trading decisions
current_price = strategy_market_data.get('current_price_closed')
```

## üéØ WHY THIS MATTERS

### Paper Trading vs Real Trading

**With current code (WRONG):**
```
10:03 AM - Check prices
- Last closed 5m candle: 10:00 AM close = $100.00
- Entry decision made on $100.00
- Exit executed at ticker price = $100.50 (from 10:03 within forming candle)
- P&L: +$0.50 ‚úÖ
```

**In real backtesting (CORRECT):**
```
10:05 AM - Candle closes
- Last closed 5m candle: 10:00 AM close = $100.00  
- Entry decision made on $100.00
- Exit decision checked at 10:05 AM close = $99.80
- P&L: -$0.20 ‚ùå
```

**Result:** Paper trading shows +$0.50, real backtest shows -$0.20!  
‚Üí **70 cents difference** = ~0.7% on $100 trade = MASSIVE in crypto intraday

---

## ‚úÖ IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS

1. **HIGH PRIORITY:** Fix `paper_trading.py` to use closed candle prices for exits
2. **MEDIUM PRIORITY:** Add `current_price_closed` field to market data structure
3. **LOW PRIORITY:** Update AI prompt to clarify which price is shown (optional, informational only)
4. **VALIDATION:** Run paper trading for 24h with fix, compare to old results

---

## üìù ADDITIONAL NOTES

### What's Working Well ‚úÖ
- Candle data fetching removes incomplete candles
- Indicator calculations use closed prices
- Entry prices from risk management are correct
- ATR-based stops use proper closed candle data

### What Needs Attention ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Cooldown system (lines 148-193) is unrelated to look-ahead bias but works correctly
- Trade execution logic for opposite signals (lines 94-138) is good
- Partial trade splitting (lines 207-349) is unrelated but appears correct

### Testing Recommendation
After fixing, compare:
1. **Old results:** Paper trading with ticker price exits
2. **New results:** Paper trading with closed candle exits
3. **Expected:** New results should be slightly worse (more realistic)

---

## üîç GREP PATTERNS FOR VERIFICATION

After fixing, verify with:
```bash
# Find any remaining ticker price usage in trading logic
grep -n "get_current_price" src/agents/paper_trading.py

# Verify closed candle usage
grep -n "iloc\[-1\]" src/agents/paper_trading.py

# Check for comments that might be outdated
grep -n "close of last candle" src/agents/paper_trading.py
```

---

## üîß APPLIED FIX

### What Was Changed

**File:** `paper_trading.py`  
**Lines:** 101-114

**Before:**
```python
current_price = strategy_market_data.get('current_price')  # TICKER (real-time)
print(f"   Exit price: ${current_price:.2f} (close of last candle)")  # Wrong comment
```

**After:**
```python
# Use last CLOSED candle price (not ticker) to avoid look-ahead bias
tf_lower = strategy_analysis.get('indicators', {}).get('lower_tf', {}).get('timeframe')
if tf_lower and strategy_market_data and 'timeframes' in strategy_market_data:
    candles = strategy_market_data['timeframes'][tf_lower]
    current_price = float(candles['close'].iloc[-1])  # CLOSED candle
else:
    # Fallback to ticker only if closed candle data not available
    current_price = strategy_market_data.get('current_price')
    print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: Using ticker price as fallback (no closed candle data)")
    
print(f"   Exit price: ${current_price:.2f} (last closed candle)")  # Correct comment
```

### Result
- ‚úÖ Opposite signal exits now use closed candle prices
- ‚úÖ Consistent with entry price logic (all from closed candles)
- ‚úÖ No more look-ahead bias in paper trading
- ‚úÖ Results will now match real backtesting
