# üîß Partial Trades SL Fix

## Problem Identified

**Before Fix:**
```
Both partial trades had SAME stop loss:
  Partial 1: Entry $192.42, SL $191.76, TP $193.08
  Partial 2: Entry $192.42, SL $191.76, TP $193.74
                           ‚Üë SAME SL!

Issue: If SL hit ‚Üí BOTH positions close ‚Üí 2x loss!
```

---

## Solution: Different SL for Each Partial

### New Logic

**Partial 1 (50% TP):**
- Keeps **original SL** (full protection)
- Quick exit target (50% of full TP distance)
- Full risk but quick reward

**Partial 2 (Full TP):**
- Gets **tighter SL** (50% distance to entry)
- Break-even style protection
- Reduced risk, let winner run

---

## Implementation

```python
# Calculate different SL for each partial
if action == 'LONG':
    sl_partial1 = original_sl              # Full SL
    sl_partial2 = entry - (entry - original_sl) * 0.5  # 50% tighter
else:  # SHORT
    sl_partial1 = original_sl              # Full SL
    sl_partial2 = entry + (original_sl - entry) * 0.5  # 50% tighter
```

---

## Example (LONG trade)

### Before Fix
```
Entry:  $192.42
SL:     $191.76 (both trades)

Partial 1: SL $191.76, TP $193.08
  Risk: $0.66
  
Partial 2: SL $191.76, TP $193.74
  Risk: $0.66

Total risk if SL hit: $1.32 ‚ùå
```

### After Fix
```
Entry:  $192.42
SLs:    Different per partial

Partial 1: SL $191.76, TP $193.08
  Risk: $0.66
  
Partial 2: SL $192.09, TP $193.74
  Risk: $0.33  ‚Üê 50% LESS!

Total risk if both SL: $0.99 ‚úÖ
Saved: $0.33 per trade
```

---

## Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Price Hits Full SL
```
Price drops to $191.76:
  Before: Both close ‚Üí -$1.32
  After:  Partial 2 already out at $192.09 ‚Üí -$0.99 ‚úÖ
```

### Scenario 2: Price Moves Up
```
Price moves to $193.08:
  Partial 1: Closes at TP ‚Üí +$0.66 ‚úÖ
  Partial 2: Still running with SL at $192.09 (in profit!)
  
Then price moves to $193.74:
  Partial 2: Closes at full TP ‚Üí +$1.32 ‚úÖ
  
Total: +$1.98 (same as before)
```

### Scenario 3: Price Whipsaws
```
Price moves to $193.00, then drops to $192.05:
  Partial 1: Still running (SL at $191.76)
  Partial 2: Closes at SL $192.09 ‚Üí -$0.33
  
Before fix: Would lose both at $191.76 ‚Üí -$1.32
After fix: Only lose partial 2 ‚Üí -$0.33, partial 1 still active ‚úÖ
```

## Benefits

### 1. Reduced Risk on Runner
```
Partial 2 (runner) has 50% less risk
Allows position to breathe
Better for letting winners run
```

### 2. Protection Against Double Loss
```
If price goes against you:
  Before: Lose BOTH positions at same SL
  After:  Partial 2 stops out earlier, saves capital
```

### 3. Asymmetric Risk/Reward
```
Partial 1: Full risk, quick reward
Partial 2: Reduced risk, larger reward
Overall: Better risk profile
```

### 4. Natural Position Management
```
Acts like manual trader:
  - Take partial profit
  - Move remaining SL to break-even
  - Let winner run with reduced risk
```

## Statistics Impact

**Expected Improvements:**

### Win Rate
- Unchanged (same entry logic)
- But smaller losses when wrong

### Average Loss
- Reduced by ~25-33%
- Double SL scenarios avoided

### Risk/Reward
- Improved from partial 2
- Runner has better profile

### Maximum Drawdown
- Lower (smaller losses)
- Capital preservation

## Example Output

### Before (Old SL Logic)
```
üìù Creating trades:
  Partial 1: Entry $192.42, SL $191.76, TP $193.08
  Partial 2: Entry $192.42, SL $191.76, TP $193.74

‚ùå SL Hit @ $191.76:
  Partial 1: -$0.66
  Partial 2: -$0.66
  Total: -$1.32
```

### After (New SL Logic)
```
üìù Creating trades:
  Partial 1: Entry $192.42, SL $191.76, TP $193.08 (Full SL)
  Partial 2: Entry $192.42, SL $192.09, TP $193.74 (Tight SL)
                            ‚Üë DIFFERENT!

‚úÖ Partial 2 SL @ $192.09:
  Partial 2: -$0.33
  Partial 1: Still running
  
‚ùå Then Partial 1 SL @ $191.76:
  Partial 1: -$0.66
  Total: -$0.99 (saved $0.33!)
```

---

## Risk Comparison

### Old System (Same SL)
```
Position Size: 2x
Each Risk: $0.66
Total Risk: $1.32
Risk if both stop: $1.32 ‚ùå
```

### New System (Different SL)
```
Position 1:
  Size: 1x
  Risk: $0.66
  
Position 2:
  Size: 1x  
  Risk: $0.33 ‚Üê 50% reduced!
  
Total Risk: $0.99
Risk if both stop: $0.99 ‚úÖ
Savings: $0.33 (25% less)
```

---

## Configuration

Currently set to **50% tighter** for partial 2:
```python
sl_partial2 = entry - (entry - original_sl) * 0.5
```

Can be adjusted:
- `0.25` = 25% tighter (more conservative)
- `0.5` = 50% tighter (balanced) ‚Üê Current
- `0.75` = 75% tighter (very tight, near break-even)

---

## Summary

‚úÖ **Partial 1**: Original SL (full protection, quick exit)  
‚úÖ **Partial 2**: Tighter SL (50% reduced risk, let run)  
‚úÖ **Benefit**: Better risk management, capital preservation  
‚úÖ **Impact**: ~25-33% reduction in average loss scenarios  
‚úÖ **Status**: Active immediately on next trade  

**Problem SOLVED! Each partial now has appropriate SL for its target.** üéØ
